## What is VSCode Elements?

The "webview API" enables extensions to build entirely customizable views within Visual Studio Code.
While the VSCode API grants access to different UI elements, none of these UI widgets are functional
in the "webview." VSCode Elements addresses this by re-implementing these UI controls as web
components (aka custom elements), and introducing some new ones. This allows for the creation of
user interfaces that look like the native user interface of VSCode.

## Installation

You can access the library as NPM package:

```bash
npm i @vsc-elements/elements
```

### Including the bundled version

This is the most straightforward method, and while it may not be the most optimized, it gets the job done.

```html
<script
  src="node_modules/@vsc-elements/elements/dist/bundled.js"
  type="module"
></script>
```

### Importing only necessary components

```typescript
import "@vsc-elements/elements/dist/vscode-button/index.js";
```

## Usage

The imported components will be automatically registered. Once registered,
Vscode Elements can be used like standard HTML elements. A standard default view
can be provided using the `:defined()` pseudo-class until the element is
registered.

```css
vscode-buttton:not(:defined) {
  display: inline-block;
  height: 26px;
  visibility: hidden;
  width: 100px;
}
```

### Properties and attributes

Custom elements are configurable through properties and attributes. Properties used in JavaScript
while attributes are used in HTML.

An example of using a property:

```javascript
const badge = document.querySelector("vscode-badge");
badge.variant = "activity-bar-counter";
```

An attribute example

```html
<vscode-badge variant="activity-bar-counter"></vscode-badge>
```

The attribute name may differs from the property name. In the API documentation, the attribute
corresponding to the property is always indicated if it exists.

#### Attribute and property reflection

Property reflection means that the related attribute will be synchronized when the property is
changed. When a property is reflected it will be indicated with the <ApiDocsBadge flag="reflected" /> 
badge in the API documentation.

### Methods

Methods are callable functions on the element instances.

```javascript
const textfield = document.querySelector('vscode-textfield');
textfield.reportValidity();
```

### Events

Most of the components dispatch events.

```javascript
const tabs = document.querySelector('vscode-tabs');
tabs.addEventListener('vsc-tabs-select', () => {
  console.log('A tab has been selected.');
});
```

### Slots

Slots are used to accept HTML content. 
The default slot, which is the content between the HTML tags, is the most common slot:

```html
<vscode-button>Click here</vscode-button>
```

Many components have named slots. In the following example the badge component
is placed in the `decorations` slot.

```html
<vscode-collapsible title="Decorations example" class="collapsible">
  <vscode-badge variant="counter" slot="decorations">99</vscode-badge>
  <p>
    Suspendisse potenti. Maecenas eu egestas metus. Nulla eget placerat mi, et
    efficitur augue.
  </p>
</vscode-collapsible>
```

### Custom CSS properties

The appearance of Vscode Elements can be configured using custom CSS properties. These variables 
are provided by VSCode, and it is not recommended to change them manually, although they can be 
modified if necessary.

```css
vscode-button {
  --vscode-button-hoverBackground: red;
}
```
