## What is VSC Elements?

The "webview API" enables extensions to build entirely customizable views within Visual Studio Code.
While the VSCode API grants access to different UI elements, none of these UI widgets are functional
in the "webview." VSC Elements addresses this by re-implementing these UI controls as web
components (aka custom elements), and introducing some new ones. This allows for the creation of interfaces that seamlessly
integrate into the native user interface of VSCode.

## Comparison between VSCode Webview UI Toolkit and VSC Elements

The [VSCode Webview UI Toolkit](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-webview-ui-toolkit) serves as the official component library for crafting UI within the webview. 
Despite the apparent redundancy of VSCode Webview Elements, it predates the release of the VSCode Webview UI Toolkit. 
However, it remains a viable option to explore. VSCode Webview Elements are essentially "reverse-engineered" components, 
aiming to faithfully replicate the pixel-perfect appearance of VSCode's "native" look, whereas the Webview UI Toolkit 
achieves a similar look. Another advantage is the broader selection of components available with VSCode Webview Elements.

## Installation

You can access the library as NPM package:

```bash
npm i @vsc-elements/elements
```

## Installing

### Including the bundled version

This is the most straightforward method, and while it may not be the most optimized, it gets the job done.

```html
<script src="node_modules/@vsc-elements/elements/dist/bundled.js" type="module"></script>
```

### Importing only necessary components

ES6 import syntax can be used.
